# Project Scope
There is an abundance of self-hosted CalDav servers out there, yet basically nothing to actually display the data with!

Luna aims to be a *self-hosted CalDav calendar client web application*. That is, Luna will let you connect to CalDav servers, iCal links and more. It will manage all the connections in the background and serve you a view with all your calendars and their events, as you have come to expect from a commercial calendar application.

Ultimately, Luna should become a fully offline-capable *Progressive Web Application (PWA)*, so you can still manage your calendars without an internet connection. Upon reconnecting to the internet, all your events will synchronize with the backend.

This approach ensures out-of-the-box platform cross-compatibility: You will be able to use Luna inside your favourite web browser, as well as install it as a PWA.

Currently, this project is still very much **work-in-progress** and is nowhere near being production-ready. Nevertheless, I have high hopes for one day replacing the propriatary calendar apps I use with Luna.
